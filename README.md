Neural Network for Time Series Forecasting
===

This is a simple project i've done, as an attemption to understand a MultiLayer perceptron Neural Network, using a BackPropagation as a learning algorithm applied to a time series forecasting.  
I got all the algorithms and the explanations from a paper on Artificial Neuron Networks written  by Anul K. Jain, J. Mao, K.M. Mohiuddin.
